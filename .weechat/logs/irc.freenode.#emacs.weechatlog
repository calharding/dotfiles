2016-03-23 16:35:31	gemie	cvandusen: why not learn emacs lisp? I love emacs as an editor but would be nice to be able to read source code since the documentation is many times lacking etc and of course also to write some own stuff that I need so I don't have to get a package that has what I ask for but with 10x more other stuff that I don't need etc.

2016-03-23 16:37:09	mns	or even to debug issues like the one I have right now:  package.el has connecting to melpa when there is a proxy involved.  It used to work when I set it up initially a couple of weeks ago.  Doesn't any more.

2016-03-23 16:45:20	Hastouki	paluche: right, but the author already offers projectile-switch-project-action, which just needs the right "CD" command

2016-03-23 16:45:42	wgreenhouse	gemie: C-h f display-buffer will give an idea of some of the possibilities, and there's also C-h v display-buffer-alist which provides a kind of override facility, to decide how a window that matches some characteristic should be created/displayed
