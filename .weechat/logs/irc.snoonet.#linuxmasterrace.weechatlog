2016-03-24 20:24:27	Tuxfuk_Phone2	medfly: what's the difference between netbsd's licensing and the gpl?
2016-03-24 20:24:27	medfly	let's be honest now... NetBSD's licensing is *weird*
2016-03-24 20:24:28	whitephoenix	R0flcopt3r, my sd card was giving me issues so I'm doing a full format on it then reimaging

2016-03-24 20:24:28	shiro	medfly: A webcomic once explained it to me as "You can lend your toys to your friend, but make sure he gives them back"
2016-03-24 20:24:28	medfly	Tuxfuk_Phone2: it's mostly various versions of BSD license
2016-03-24 20:24:28	Tuxfuk_Phone2	oh okay
2016-03-24 20:24:28	medfly	some of the userland is GPL, I think it may be optional
2016-03-24 20:24:28	medfly	there's no license mismatch between the two

2016-03-24 20:26:06	medfly	more in the sense that they have the means to care I guess
2016-03-24 20:26:15	Tuxfuk_Phone2	why dont they want the gpl?
2016-03-24 20:27:06	medfly	GPL makes your project GPL
