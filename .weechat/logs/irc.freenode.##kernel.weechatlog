2016-03-24 13:20:06	kostrahb	Hi, how kernel handles response from usb slave device? I used usb skeleton driver to create device file to send (ascii) commands to a motor controll unit. It should gave me some response (according to manual "immediately after recieving the command"; also in ascii) but when reading the file there is no response.
